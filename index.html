        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29268110/"><i>Smile 2</i></a> has hit theaters as October’s premier horror release, once again bringing back director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6475689/?ref_=tt_ov_dr_1">Parker Finn</a>, whose 2022 debut with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15474916/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><i>Smile</i></a> made unsettling grins the new horror staple. The first film followed Dr. Rose Cotter, played by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1788739/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_sosie%2520ba">Sosie Bacon</a>, in a nightmarish attempt to escape a curse marked by creepy, unshakable smiles that passed from one unfortunate soul to the next. While the original was met with solid reviews and packed a punch, it didn’t quite shake off comparisons to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_it%2520follow"><i>It Follows</i></a>, a comparison that didn’t exactly help it out, given how masterfully <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1379002/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_david%2520rob">David Robert Mitchell</a>’s 2014 horror executed the same relentless, curse-driven fear. Even so, Smile managed enough intrigue, suspense, and effective jump scares to leave horror fans craving a sequel—and the box office was more than happy to agree.

            In <i>Smile 2</i>, everything gets cranked up a notch: the stakes are higher, the scares are sharper, and the runtime stretches over two hours. Yet with its relentless tension, the film barely gives audiences a chance to breathe. Just when you start feeling safe, that sinister, bone-chilling smile finds its way back into frame, pulling viewers right back into the nightmare. While the “who’s real” concept was a highlight of the first movie, this sequel pushes it further into a “who and <i>what</i> is real” territory, deepening the psychological horror and adding layers of paranoia that work surprisingly well, keeping viewers tense and guessing until the end. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This round, the curse’s latest victim is pop star Skye Riley, played by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4305463/?ref_=tt_ov_st_1">Naomi Scott</a>, who absolutely nails the role of a paranoid, unraveling celebrity. Her performance is intense and, in many ways, more gripping than her predecessor’s portrayal. Between the hair-ripping, the constant water-chugging, and darting eyes, Scott pulls off a brilliantly disturbing descent into terror. Despite her character’s fame, Skye is disturbingly isolated, offering a dark commentary on celebrity life and the hidden despair that so many public figures face. Skye’s blend of trauma, guilt, and dread makes her an ideal target for the smile-loving entity that feasts on vulnerability. Scott’s portrayal feels harrowingly intimate, giving the audience a deeper connection with her character’s struggle and isolation.

            In terms of visuals, it takes its horror atmosphere to the next level, with Finn employing a chilling, almost surreal visual style that magnifies the psychological horror. The camera work and lighting are meticulously crafted, intensifying the movie's sense of dread. From disorienting close-ups to dim, claustrophobic settings, every shot seems designed to keep the viewer trapped in Skye’s spiraling mental state, making it one of the more visually impressive horror films of the year.
        </p>

            However, this film doesn’t always bring the same level of creativity as it does terror. While it’s undeniably intense and suspenseful, it doesn’t break any new ground for the horror genre. Much like its predecessor, it borrows elements from other well-known horror films—the aforementioned <i>It Follows</i> being one of the most notable comparisons due to its exploration of a cursed, predatory force. For audiences familiar with these tropes, <i>Smile 2</i> may not feel entirely fresh or original. Some of the scares feel like déjà vu, echoing scenes from the first film—and for those hoping for fresh frights, this repetition can make these moments fall a bit flat. Still, thanks to Finn’s skilled direction, it does manage to inject enough suspense and shock value to keep the experience engaging. Even if it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, the film is still crafted with enough skill to provide a thrilling ride.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another shortfall lies in the film’s lack of depth surrounding the curse’s lore. It raises questions about the nature and origins of the entity, but it ultimately fails to provide answers or delve deeper into the mythology. For fans hoping to learn more about the source of the evil, this lack of exploration may feel like a missed opportunity. The entity remains as cryptic as ever, tantalizing but without the added depth that could have enriched the plot and set the film apart from its predecessor. In this regard, <i>Smile 2</i> feels more like a continuation of the same nightmare rather than an evolution of the story.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, it's a solid horror sequel, delivering heightened suspense, unnerving atmosphere, and well-timed scares that will satisfy fans of the first movie. It’s intense, thrilling, and undeniably fun, even if it doesn’t reinvent the genre. Despite its flaws, it stands out as one of the year’s better horror releases, setting the stage for a <a href="https://www.justjared.com/2024/10/20/smile-3-sequel-in-the-works-director-speaks-out/">potential third installment</a> that could take the franchise in bolder directions. While it would be refreshing to see the plot take bigger creative risks in the future, this sequel still serves as a suspenseful, skillfully crafted successor. With <i>Smile 2</i>, Parker Finn has poised the series to become a modern horror mainstay—and horror fans are likely to keep coming back, if only to see that unsettling grin one more time.
